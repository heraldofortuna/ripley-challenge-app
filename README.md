### Prepare and run the backend:

First, after cloning the project locally, install the dependencies to the local in /backend directory. (Note: I use 16.13.1 version in this project.)

```html

And start up the server:

```

Finally, navigate to http://localhost:3001 in your web browser.

## Comments

- You can filter the table, in addition to sorting in ascending and descending order with respect to various fields.

- Honestly, I managed to finish all the application requirements except one: Filtered by backend. I feel like I lacked time and knowledge about backend.

- The application is responsive.
